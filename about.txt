This is a quick program I had to write for this week's homework assignment in my number theory course. The objective was to find the first
10 10-digit primes. I did this by first creating a fast modular calculator, that determines the value of b^e mod(m). I then used
Fermat's Little Theorem as a primality test:  a^(p-1) (is equiv to) 1 mod(p), for some prime p. I wrote an increasing loop starting at the 
first odd number with 10 digits, and continuously sent in my number as the prime p to the fast modular calculator, and any time 1 is returned, p is known to be prime. The loop runs until 10 primes are found.
